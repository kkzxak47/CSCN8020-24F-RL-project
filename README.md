The problem being tackled involves developing an intelligent agent capable of autonomous navigation on a multilane highway. The goal is to optimize the vehicle's driving performance by ensuring safe and efficient movement in a dynamic environment populated with other vehicles. The objective of this project is to design and evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms that optimize driving strategies for a vehicle in a simulated highway environment.

The algorithm used are,
DQN
PPO
A2C
